- 👋 Hi, I’m @FinnMcKinley
- 👀 I’m interested in anything that involves coding, tech and engineering. LEARNING is everything!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python mainly, as well as touches of C# and web development. I'm young so im just looking to learn and find what i enjoy doing or what im good at.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool projects, becuase I can never stay doing one thing for long. Looking for a mentor or someone to help me learn coding and get better!
- 📫 How to reach me Email me at finnmckinley@proton.me or hit me up on LinkedIn

I am studying Engineering at University so I don't have a ton of time for projects, and always forget to post the ones I do actually do.
