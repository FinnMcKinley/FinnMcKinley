- 👋 Hi, I’m @FinnMcKinley
- 👀 I’m interested in anything that involves coding or tech. LEARNING
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# for Unity and gamemaking, and Python. Im young and unqualified so im just looking to learn and find what i enjoy doing or what im good at.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally anything but i have no attention span so I can never stay doing one thing for long. Looking for a mentor or someone to help me learn coding and get better!
- 📫 How to reach me Email me at finnmckinley@proton.me or hit me up on Twitter @Finn_Mckinley_

I am still in school and have to juggle learning to code with school, sports and part time jobs but I geuninely enjoy coding and try to do it as much as possible.
